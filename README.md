# Data Analyst

## Python | Web Scrapping | Machine Learning | SQL | Tableau | MongoDB | Git | Jupyter 


Hi there!

I'm a junior data analyst with the goal of being an expert data ingineer. I love coding and I really enjoy "playing" with data. 

###  · Numpy · Pandas · Matplotlib · Sklearn · Plotly · Seaborn · API ·

Here you can find some of my projects with which I have started this new path in the world of data:


1. [Mini-project](https://github.com/isabel-searle/mini-project): This program emulates the game of 'guess the number'. 

2. [Pandas](https://github.com/isabel-searle/pandas-project): Data cleaning and visualization

3. [Pipeline](https://github.com/isabel-searle/pipelines-project): This was a research of the best reviewed hotels in US where I applied webscraping to Expedia, Booking and Tripadvisor.

4. [Geospatial-data-project](https://github.com/isabel-searle/geospatial-data-project): In this project we want to analyze the best location for our office using geospatial queries with MongoDB, Folium python library, API requests, web scraping, and Tableau.

5. [Boston-linear-regression](https://github.com/isabel-searle/boston-linear-regression): Playingowith the Boston sklearn dataset.

6. [API chat-api](https://github.com/isabel-searle/chat-api): I created an API for a supposed chat of a company, through which the feeling of each departement is studied according with the language the employees use. The API is connected with SQL, the API allows to feed the database and get the data to be analysed by a Natural Language Processing Tool (NLTK).

7. [Kaggle competition - diamonds](https://github.com/isabel-searle/diamonds): Here I had to predict the price of the diamonds according with a dataset. I built a function to train the data with different models and features so that I got the best metrics and I won the competition with the RandomForestRegressor model!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀

8. [Sentiment-analysis](https://github.com/isabel-searle/sentiment-analysis): Analysis of sentiment from 286.099 tweets through all US without bias (no filters) during the post presidential election period.
